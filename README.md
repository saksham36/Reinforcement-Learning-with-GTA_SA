Self Driving Vehicle in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

Hey Guys! 
Welcome to my small side project.
I am attempting to make a self-driven vehicle in GTA San Andreas. Why GTA:SA you might ask?
Simple! It's a relatively small game which allows my slow system to handle, also the open world in GTA gives a new situation to train on.

I would love your valuable suggestions and feedback.
